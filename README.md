# Virtual-Try-on-Closet-using-GAN-SOC
This project is part of the Summer of Code initiative, focusing on creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using OpenCV and PyTorch to tackle the virtual try-on problem. The goal is to develop a system capable of simulating clothing try-ons in a virtual environment.
